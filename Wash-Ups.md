No Longer a Post Mortem...... It's a WashUp 

We have been looking at addressing the language that we use in the web team to ensure that we are better communicating the processes that we have in place and how best to communicate these across the business. Because of this we have decided it's time to refresh the process formally known as blameless post mortem's and label these more generically as wash-ups.  We believe that this helps us to refocus on finding positive actions and encourages stronger team collaboration and reflection on issues.

Here are the notes of what's been agreed moving forward: 
A wash-up can be held after any significant event that has happened where we believe actions can be taken so that we can better improve process moving forward.  This could be following an expedite issue, or at the end of a large project.

A new wash-up meeting template has been created that should help people to prepare for the meeting and ensure that all information on why the meeting is taking place has been filled in and circulated to all relevant parties in advance.

The wash-up meeting itself should be totally focused on what we have learned and what we can improve for next time.

After each wash-up gathering, one attendee will be nominated to send an update round to the rest of the team with a brief email summary and attach the meeting notes.

We are putting all of this in place following the successful first trial of the new template over the last few week.

For additional info - or any other questions on holding a wash-up please feel free to contact any of the Scrum Masters who are happy to help facilitate these future meetings.
