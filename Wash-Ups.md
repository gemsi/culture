A wash-up can be held after any significant event that has happened where we believe actions can be taken so that we can better improve process moving forward.  This could be following an expedite issue or at the end of a large project.

A new wash-up meeting template has been created that should help people to prepare for the meeting and ensure that all information on why the meeting is taking place has been filled in and circulated to all relevant parties in advance.

The wash-up meeting itself should be totally focused on what we have learned and what we can improve for next time.

After each wash-up gathering, the facilitator or note taker needs to send an update round to the rest of the team with a brief email summary and attach the meeting notes and add any actions to the wash-up board on Jira.

For additional info or any other questions on holding a wash-up please feel free to contact any of the People Leads or Agile Coaches who are happy to help.
